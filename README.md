#  Credit Worthiness Prediction

This project predicts whether a loan applicant is likely to receive loan or not and the credit worthiness (probability of receiving loan) of the applicant. It uses machine learning techniques and an XGBoost model fine tuned with GridSearchCV, and Flask API for serving predictions

##  Project Structure

---
## üß† Workflow
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
    - Checked for missing values
    - Reviewed Statistics like mean, skewness, median etc.

2. **Preprocessing:**  
   - Handles missing values, encoding, and scaling.  
   - Saves preprocessor as `preprocessor.pkl`.

3. **Model Training & Tuning:**  
   - Uses Logistic Regression, SVM, and XGBoost.  
   - GridSearchCV for hyperparameter optimization.  
   - Best models saved in `/models`.

4. **Evaluation:**  
   - Accuracy, F1, Recall, and ROC-AUC.  
   - Visual comparisons using Seaborn plots.

5. **Prediction:**  
   -Test predictions via `tests/making_predictions.py`.
   - Flask API deployment handled by `deploy.py`
